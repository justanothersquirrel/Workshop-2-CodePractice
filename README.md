# ************************\_\_\_************************ Workshop-2-CodePractice

This code was made to practice the conenction between server and sketch code. looking at Node.js Socket.io JavaScript.
This sketch is implemented from rebecca-aston's tutorials and lab workshops. The original code can be found in the package mouse-party-main.zip.

# ************************\_\_\_************************ Diary & over view

I firstly tried to make this code interact with sound when objectsa re inside the circle or radious zone. but it turned up more complicated than I thought so I changed the idea to make the objects repel from the circle and to create a netwrok bteween other users the circle will party whenever any user touches the the objects.
************\_\_\_\_********** Next step**
I have to figure out how to conenct app.js witht the sketch so users can share the same mvoement of the objects.
