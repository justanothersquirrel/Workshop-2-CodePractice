# Workshop-2-CodePractice

This code was made to practice the conenction between server and sketch code. looking at Node.js Socket.io JavaScript.
This sketch is implemented from rebecca-aston's tutorials and lab workshops. The original code can be found in the package mouse-party-main.zip.

# Diary & over view

I firstly tried to make this code interact with sound when objectsa re inside the circle or radious zone. but it turned up more complicated than I thought so I changed the idea to make the objects repel from the circle and to create a netwrok bteween other users the circle will party whenever any user touches the the objects.

øøøøøøøøøøøøøøøøøøøøøøøøøøøøøøøøøøøøøøøøøøøøøøøøøøøøøøøøøøøøøøøøøøøøøøøø
I have to:
Figure out how to conenct app.js witht the sketch so users can share the same mvoement of the objects.
The object are very slow on mobile devices
the circle is not sharing the aprty on different users
