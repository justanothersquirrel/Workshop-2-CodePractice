# Workshop-2-CodePractice

This code was made to practice the conenction between server and sketch code. looking at Node.js Socket.io JavaScript.
This sketch is implemented from rebecca-aston's tutorials and lab workshops. The original code can be found in the package mouse-party-main.zip.

# Diary & over view

I firstly tried to make this code interact with sound when objectsa re inside the circle or radious zone. but it turned up more complicated than I thought so I changed the idea to make the objects repel from the circle and to create a netwrok bteween other users the circle will party whenever any user touches the the objects.

øøøøøøøøøøøøøøøøøøøøøøøøøøøøøøøøøøøøøøøøøøøøøøøøøøøøøøøøøøøøøøøøøøøøøøøø
I have to:
Figure out how to conenct app.js witht the sketch so users can share the same mvoement of the objects.
The object are very slow on mobile devices
the circle is not sharing the aprty on different users

It seems that the circles are shown between all browsing users to the server.

^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^ The **issues** and this is not an issue, but maybe thats what makes an issue an issue is when it doesnt go the way it was planned to do so. bakc to the techincal issues I shall fix with more knwoeldge in the future:

- when the mouse/circle in browser A touches objects in browser B it calls the part circle to colour in browser A
- when mouse/circle in browser A or B touches an object of the same browser it calls the circle to party locally.
  ------->> what needs ot be happening is for the party circle to t
